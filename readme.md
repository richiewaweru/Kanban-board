# Kanban board

## Description

This project is an implementation of Kanban board.It has 3 states namely;

1. To do
- Refers to tasks that have not been been started and completed.
2. Doing
- Refers to tasks that have been been started but not completed.
3. Done
- Refers to tasks that have been been started but not completed.

Your assignment is to write a Flask application which provides the functionality
associated with a Kanban board. This includes:

1. Creating a new task
2. Moving tasks to different states
3. Deleting tasks

Please find a few example Kanban board websites and use them so that you have a
clear idea of what is needed. Note that the professional versions look much
nicer and have many more bells and whistles than are asked for in this
assignment! Your visual design can be very straightforward.

**(Optional)** As an extension, make a personalizable Kanban board. This means
that every user has their own account, and can see only their own tasks.  For
this you will need to create users, and be able to log them in and out.  Each
task will also need to be associated with a particular user.

## Submission

1. Your primary submission must be a PDF listing of your Python code. This will allow your grader to attach feedback to the code in the PDF.
2. Your secondary submission must be a Zip file containing all the code and documentation for your project. This will allow your grader to run your code and interact with the app.
3. Finally, you need to demo your project. Provide a link in your `README.md` file to a screen recording of you using your app and explaining what you are doing. Demo all the features of your project. The screen recording should be at most 5 minutes long but probably more like 2 minutes long in most cases.
